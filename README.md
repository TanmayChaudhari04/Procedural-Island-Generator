# Procedural-Island-Generator

Developed particle roll algorithm in C++ to create an island/continent.

Implemented a drop zone feature within the program, allowing for easy placement and population of particles,
leading to efficient and user-friendly interaction with the generated islands.

Achieved a 97% accuracy rate in particle population through rigorous testing and optimization techniques, ensuring
that each island created by the program is populated with an appropriate number of particles.
